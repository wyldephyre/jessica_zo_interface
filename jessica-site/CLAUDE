Jessica – Cognitive Interface (Zo Computer Site)
=================================================

This is the Zo-native frontend for Jessica, an ADHD-optimized cognitive
prosthetic AI chat interface.

Architecture
------------
- index.tsx   → Hono server. SSR renders the initial HTML page, serves
                static assets from /public, and proxies chat requests to
                the Zo AI backend via POST /chat.
- public/app.js → Vanilla JavaScript client. Manages chat state, DOM
                   updates, context switching, typing indicator, and
                   auto-scroll. No frameworks – pure DOM manipulation.
- Tailwind CSS via CDN (Play version) – no build step needed.
- Google Fonts "Inter" for typography.

Routes
------
GET  /          → Serves the full chat UI (server-rendered HTML).
POST /chat      → Accepts { message, context, history } and returns
                  { reply }. Proxies to Zo's /zo/ask API.
/public/*       → Static file serving (app.js, future assets).

Environment Variables
---------------------
ZO_API_KEY  – API key for Zo AI backend (has a built-in fallback).
ZO_API_URL  – Full URL for the AI endpoint
              (default: https://api.zo.computer/zo/ask).

Design Principles
-----------------
- ADHD-optimized: dark theme, minimal cognitive load, single-column layout.
- User messages → blue (bg-blue-600), Jessica messages → emerald (bg-emerald-700).
- Three context modes: Personal, Business, Creative (context switcher in header).
- Typing indicator with bouncing dots during API calls.
- Auto-scroll to newest message.
- Mobile responsive – works on phones and tablets.

Development
-----------
  bun install
  bun run dev        # starts with hot reload on http://localhost:3000

Deployment
----------
Upload this folder as a Zo Computer site. It will be available at
jessica-*.zocomputer.io once published.
